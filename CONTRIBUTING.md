## New contributor guide
To get an overview of the project, read the [README](../README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:
- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started
I accept any form of contributions you want to make to the repository! Although I may not accept a pull request or suggestion, I will always review and consider it before passing on it.

### Issues
#### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with AttributeCalloutPack, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/attributeerror/FivePD-AttributeCalloutPack/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue
Scan through the [existing issues](https://github.com/attributeerror/FivePD-AttributeCalloutPack/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, issues will only ever be assigned to myself. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix and leave a comment on the issue saying you've done so.

### Make Changes
#### Make changes locally
1. Fork this repository.
    - Using GitHub Desktop:
        - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
        - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!
    - Using the command line:
        - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until I'm ready to merge them.
2. Install or update **.NET Framework** & **Visual Studio** - ensure you develop using **.NET Framework 4.5.2**.
3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

#### Commit your update
Commit the changes once you're happy with them, and push your branch up to your copy of the repository.

#### Pull request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request (PR).
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps me to understand what changes you've made in your PR.
- Don't forget to [link your PR to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so that the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, I will review your proposal. I may ask questions or request additional information, so please be sure to keep checking your PR!
- I may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [Git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
